# Financial Tracker Application  
*Track and manage your personal finances with ease*

---

## Project Description

The **Financial Tracker** application is designed to help users monitor and manage their income and expenses efficiently. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete financial transactions, categorize them, and get a clear summary of their overall financial status including total income, expenses, and current balance. Users can also filter their transactions by date or category and set monthly budgets for better financial control.

This application is intended for anyone who wants to take control of their personal finances, including students, professionals, or families looking to budget and plan their spending.  

I am interested in this project because managing personal finances is a valuable skill that benefits everyone. Developing this application will not only improve my programming skills but also provide a practical tool that can be used daily to encourage responsible financial habits.
